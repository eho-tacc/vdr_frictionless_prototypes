# Versioned Datasets Frictionless Prototypes

The purpose of this repository is to prototype migration of datasets managed by the [Versioned Datasets Repository](1) to the [Frictionless](2) data standard. The subdirectories of this repository contain either:
* Prototypical [Frictionless Data Packages](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/), for instance [./vdr_migration](./vdr_migration).
* Directories for reporting/tracking of issues submitted to [frictionless-py API](3)

For complete logs on work and progress performed in this repository, please see Ethan's diary entries in his [vimwiki](https://github.com/eho-tacc/vimwiki/tree/master/docsrc/diary) starting 12/2020.
