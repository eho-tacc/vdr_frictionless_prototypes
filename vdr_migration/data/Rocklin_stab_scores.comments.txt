# Includes stability scores and predicted unfolded-state EC50 values from CNN model.
# Now includes "calibrated" columns for consistency.
# Note that all "calibrated" columns are just copies of the corresponding "uncalibrated" column.
# Values with *_cnn_* [i.e. *_pred_* and stabilityscore_*] are based on this (probably-improved) model.
# Experimental stability scores generated for all proteins in the Rocklin experiments.
# 1585 proteins showed up in more than one round. Their values were averaged.
# The list was intersected with those that have computational features generated by Hugh in Spring 2018.
