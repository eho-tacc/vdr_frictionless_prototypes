# Experimental stability scores from 100K_winter19 calibrated to Rocklin
# Calibration linear transformations: f_t(x) = 0.769210 + 1.056983*(x)  and  f_c(x) = -0.271726 + 1.293531*(x)

# Includes stability scores and predicted unfolded-state EC50 values from CNN model.
# Values with *_cnn_* [i.e. *_pred_* and stabilityscore_*] are based on this (probably-improved) model.
